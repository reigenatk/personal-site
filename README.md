### Read more about the development of this site, using my site, [here!](https://rmaa.dev/posts/my-first-blog-post)

React, GraphQL, Gatsby, Sass

Also, this website is a heavily modified version of a Udemy tutorial I did, found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/gatsby-tutorial-and-projects-course/). I recommend doing this if you're too scared to dig into the documentation but don't wanna just use a boilerplate site generator framework. It feels like you're coding (hehe im so smart) but also makes sure that you have **something** to show at the end of it.

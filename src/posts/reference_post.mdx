# My first learning experiences

One fun fact about me was, I did math contests when I was in middle + high school. And I took them
quite seriously.

I don't know, there was just something about math contests that pushed me to want to do well in them.
Maybe it was the ability to solve tough problems while looking cool in front of others. Or maybe it
was just the college app boost (if you do well enough in math contests, I firmly believe your chances
of getting into a top tier college increase dramatically- this goes for any high school contest though)

I could probably rant about my math contest history in a **whole other blog post**- but for now let's just
say I took it seriously. Kinda like someone in a sports team would take their sport.

To prepare, my dad enrolled me in a ton of math courses on this site
called [Art of Problem Solving](https://aops.com). If you ever took math contests semi-seriously
in middle + high school, you would definitely know this site. It was basically the central hub for
anything math-contest related. Think things like AMC, MATHCOUNTS, USAMO, ARML, etc.

Complete with forums, past exams, and a vibrant community of middle schoolers and high schoolers who
loved math, it was (and still is) the best place for anyone looking to get good at competitive math.

Anyways, enough ranting. AoPS was kind of my first taste of online courses. I unfortunately slacked a bit
and didn't get as much out of them as I could've. Then I failed to qualify for the AIME one year
and it motivated me to try really hard for the next- **maybe I'll write about all this someday later.**

# Back to MOOCs

These sites have courses on literally anything you can imagine. Just put it in and more than likely,
there's gonna be some course on it.

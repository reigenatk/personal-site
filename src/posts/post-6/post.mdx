# Intro 

Hello! This post will be very ranty. Fair warning!

Oh also- this font is kind of getting boring, so let's switch it up a bit...

<div className="new_font">

Boom. Is that better? Times New Roman, baby.
</div>

<div className="new_font_2">

I'm just kidding. I wouldn't make you read Times New Roman- reminds me of high school essays too much &#128552;

Anyways.. back to the post. When I first made this blog, I said I would write about things like **books, movies, and tv shows** to offset 
the technical posts. It seems as though I haven't done that yet... So here we go.

I'm mainly trying to read more books/watch more shows because I'm trying not to be a ~~complete nerd~~ &#x1f913; with no 
idea of the world of mainstream media. I mean, there are drawbacks and also strengths. On one hand, 
I don't want to be that guy who only watches <span className="lg">netflix</span> all day. On the other hand, I don't want to be
that guy whose **only hobby** is working (in my case, coding), and cannot hold a conversation with 
someone else about anything minutely different. 

<div className="ci">
    <img src="https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0rgPYj0GwZ6txpYZrzoMdhwzqg7vY6C9B-Ol7jlaz-Ox2rgpD4Tr82ZgDqkirrEohbGm=w412-h220-rw"/>
    <p>I have never watched netflix in my life... mostly because my parents think it's a waste of money &#128517;</p>
</div>

Also, it would be nice to improve my writing skills. Because as much as I want to deny what my many high 
school English teachers have said- it is very much true: *"Writing is an important skill for your life."*
Being able to communicate effectively is hard- much harder than I imagined it to be. Hell, even writing
this post- thinking about the ways in which I want to communicate my ideas to you, takes energy and thought.
And as my modern fiction teacher loved to say: "If you don't read, then how can you write?"

My final reason, (this one is a bit ridiculous) is that I would love it if I could have my 
blog be a kind of <span className="lr">time capsule</span> of sorts. I feel like so many people live their lives without documenting it well.

For instance- have you ever seen the youtube videos where people take one picture a day, and then 
do this over a year and you can see how someone grows up? I've always found that *super cool*. Now I'm not
dedicated enough to take a photo a day, but I certainly can write a blog post every month or so, just to kind 
of see how my life was like.

Like for example, I was thinking the other day about how *cool* it would be if I could see how my **parents + grandparents**
looked like when they were my age. And not just how they looked- but <span className="lg">what kind of people they were.</span> 
What kind of things did they enjoy doing? What kind of morals did they have? What personalities did they 
fit in with? The nerds? The jocks? The emo kids? &#128520;

But of course, when they were young adults, there was no internet. So there were certainly no blogs.
And I'm not blaming them for that. But I think that in an era where *the internet* is so widespread- 
growing up in a generation with access to a keyboard (which by the way, beats writing in a diary x100)- there's no reason not to ~~document a bit~~ about your 
life so **you** can look back- and perhaps even share with people who come after you- what kind of person you 
were. You know, just in case they're ever curious, like I was. I think its almost like *etching* your name 
into a stone in a way, documenting that you were once here on this blue ball, <span className="lg">floating through space...</span>

<div className="ci">
    <img src="https://pictures.abebooks.com/inventory/30371394741.jpg"/>
    <p>This blog is like a personal diary of sorts to me..</p>
</div>

Also, let's hope <span className="lb">NodeJS/React</span> doesn't become ~~depricated~~ and my blog goes down after not being maintained...
This makes me think back to the recent event in how *Adobe Flash player* is no longer supported, which 
is crazy to me. It feels like I was just playing flash games in middle school...

Anyways, weird rant over.

# The Kite Runner

<div className="ci">
    <img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zGreRPcsAtg/SvZSgRuXXmI/AAAAAAAABJ0/kDvkrEWAY7A/s280/Kite-Runner4.jpg" />
    <p>Amir and Hassan</p>
</div>

The first book I read was the Kite Runner by <span className="lr">Khaled Hosseini</span>. 

Now, short rant
about how I <span className="lg">pick my books.</span> I use rating sites... Like, a lot. I usually look 
for high rating, with a large sample size. Sometimes I think 
it's a big problem of mine- I trust the ratings too much. 
Who knows how many good shows, books and anime I'm 
missing out on because it was rated a few stars too low.

On the other hand, rating sites are usually *very accurate*. I mean look at <span className="lg">Rick and Morty</span> 
outranking Arcane... as it should.

<div className="ci">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/07uF4rA.png" alt="yea" border="0"/>
    <p>Let's gooo Pickle rick</p>
</div>

Also, the recommendations have been spot on for things like anime, and tv shows. <span className="lg">Fullmetal alchemist + Hunter X Hunter</span>
were probably the most memorable anime I have seen. <span className="lb">Game of Thrones + Breaking Bad</span> were the top 2 rated tv shows, and boy 
were they good. So it's time to take the rating system to books.

I have a pretty logical brain and so I guess I like the number aspect of it- assigning a concrete
rating to every show. On the other hand, the concept of giving <span className="lg">a rating</span> to every book is somewhat silly- just because others didn't like a 
book, doesn't mean you won't like it either! So yeah, it's a flawed system.

Sorry.. On to *The Kite Runner*

*"For you, a thousand times over" - Hassan*

- Plot: 9 / 10 ⭐
- Writing: 9.6 / 10 ⭐
- Characters: 9.7 / 10 ⭐
- Entertainment: 9.1 / 10 ⭐
- Page Count: about 350

Kite runner was about the life story <span className="lb">Amir</span>, a Afghani man who grew up in Kabul before the war and his 
friend Hassan, his father (referred to only as Baba), and the many people in their life. Before you write 
off this book as another ~~war story~~- just know that it has very little mention of war. Two thirds 
of the story goes by before any mention of the Afghanistan conflict.

Instead, the writer goes deeply into the **friendship** of Hassan and Amir- how they grew up under the same 
roof, despite Amir being a <span className="lb">Pashtun</span>, and Hassan 
being a <span className="lg">Hazara</span>, which are the two major ethnicities of Afghanistan. For some 
background, the Hazara are ~~persecuted~~ as they make up about 9 percent of the country population. 

It told the story of Amir, the rich, well off boy, compared to Hassan, the servant of the household, 
and how their once close friendship dissolved over the years despite them both wanting to maintain it.

It tells a rather *tragic* tale- I wouldn't say this book had a happy ending- and that's the *beautiful* thing.
It managed to be joyous at times, made you want to celebrate, and had ~~heart-wrenching~~ plot twists the next page.

The characters were powerful- my favorite character was actually <span className="lg">Baba</span>, the father. The way Hosseini described him-
I don't think I've ever read a character description so powerful. By the end of the book, I could practically 
envision him in my mind. It almost reminded me a bit of *my own father*. Hassan and Amir are both great characters as well.

<div className="ci">
    <img src="https://www.sbs.com.au/movies/sites/sbs.com.au.film/files/styles/full/public/images/s/i/site_28_rand_270327212_2007_the_kite_runner_627.gif?itok=JR5pMRfa"/>
    <p>The kite runner- was it Amir or Hassan? You'll have to read to find out!</p>
</div>

The writer adds a lot of *cultural background* into muslim traditions and lingo- speaking from his experience growing up in Kabul himself, despite
the story being fiction. That's what I really **appreciated** about it- I could totally believe it to be 
true. I loved his writing style- so much so that I finished the book in 2.5 days. This was also the first 
book where I felt it had some realistic tones to it- I don't want to spoil too much, but Amir and his family do eventually imigrate to America,
and I found that lots of the story felt super personal at times, because I have immigrant parents.

All in all- highly recommend! 

# Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes

<div className="ci">
    <img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1510416245l/36576608.jpg" alt="yea" border="0"/>
    <p>Flowers for Algernon...</p>
</div>

- Plot: 9.3 / 10 ⭐
- Writing: 9.3 / 10 ⭐
- Characters: 9.7 / 10 ⭐
- Entertainment: 9.3 / 10 ⭐
- Page Count: about 300

My summary: *What does it mean to be smart? What would you do to be the smartest person in the world- just for one day?*

<span className="lg">Flowers for algernon</span> is the story of Charlie Gordon, a retarded man who 
undergoes a science experiment with the one goal of <span className="lr">making him smart</span>. There are no guarantees
that this experiment will be successful, and as a result the book is always on the edge, with many plot twists. We aren't
told what exactly made him retarded. However, we are informed of his upraising- his abusive mother and sister,
and his "friends" at the bakery. His loneliness in life- his desire to be loved, to be normal.

*Flowers for Algernon* is a document of his diary as he went through the experiment, and I have to say- <span className="lr">there is not 
a happy ending at all.</span> Honestly, I felt shudders through my spine as the book was ending- it was 
a very powerful and tragic end to a very remarkable story. Hopefully I didn't spoil too much... Out of context,
I don't think this counts as one &#128517;

<div className="ci">
    <img src="https://media.springernature.com/w300/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2F536394a/MediaObjects/41586_2016_Article_BF536394a_Figa_HTML.jpg"/>
    <p>Charlie, with Algernon the mouse</p>
</div>

This book is especially powerful to me because I have a brother with *down-syndrome*, and Charlie
reminded me of my brother a lot. Most notably, the book begins with purposefully terrible grammar. 
The first 100 pages are barely understandable, full of grammar mistakes and misspellings. But this is done 
intentionally, to show the *mental state of Charlie*, the patient, before he enters the experiment.

<div className="ci">
    <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.jessicarulestheuniverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/IMG-20121023-01648.jpg"/>
    <p>My brother actually writes like this</p>
</div>

The weird thing is, *that's exactly how my brother writes too*, full of spelling mistakes and 
barely parsable grammar. <span className="lg">This book made me ponder the way my brother 
sees the world</span>- does he understand what we're saying to him? Does he know when we laugh, or when we cry,
why we do it? Or does he just sit there like Charlie, smiling, wishing he could join in, but is simply <span className="lr">unable</span>
to, <span className="lr">confounded by the bounds of his brain?</span> How many of his feelings go bottled up inside, 
unable to be expressed because he doesn't know how to say it?

It made me very grateful that I am "normal" so to speak, that I have a functioning brain, and every day I can 
get up and look forward to learning whatever my mind wants to learn. <span className="lb">We take so many things for granted</span> in daily life,
and this book made me realize that. 

I finished this book in approximately a week. I really like the writing style of Keyes, I think he does a great 
job of keeping it interesting. I *highly recommend* this book to people. I don't think I've ever cried reading a book
(or from media for that matter), but this book made me come *kind of close*.

# Silicon Valley by HBO

<div className="ci">
    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510j26LqG1L._AC_SY741_.jpg"/>
    <p>Recognize this pose?</p>
</div>

- Plot: 9.6 / 10 ⭐ (average over 4 seasons that I've seen so far)
- Characters: 12 / 10 ⭐ (my lord the characters are so good)
- Entertainment: 10 / 10 ⭐
- Number of seasons: 6

*What if a nerd, a satirical canadian, a pakistani guy, a pothead, and a really weird dude named Jared made a company?*

My lord, **Silicon Valley by HBO**, where do I even start. This show has to be one of my all time favorites,
and <span className="lb">I'm not even done with it.</span>

For one, if you think you recognize the pose they are doing, that's because it's **Steve Jobs's** iconic pose 
from his biography, written by ~~Walter Issacson~~.

<div className="ci">
    <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81VStYnDGrL.jpg"/>
    <p>This book came out shortly after he passed. It's pretty famous</p>
</div>

Now from the image you can probably tell that this show is <span className="lb">a satire</span>. *A REALLY BIG* satire. I don't recall
having laughed my lungs out as hard as I did watching the first season. It's about Richard, the genius coder 
who comes up with a revolutionary compression algorithm which will <span className="lr">change computing forever.</span>

Except, <span className="lb">Silicon valley isn't rooting for him.</span> They want a piece of the pie. And it's not pretty at all.
It follows the journey of Richard and his team as they struggle to gain funding, scale their product, fight off 
maniacal managers, CEOs, and competitors, a big lawsuit, 
and altogether survive in the techbed of the world known as *Silicon Valley*.

If you know anything about software develpoment, or consider yourself even a little bit nerdy, 
<span className="lb">I'm absolutely certain you'll love the show.</span> In fact, if you watched the show 
after seeing this and don't like it, leave me a comment or something and I'll PAY you (im not being serious)

There's not a lot of actual coding, but 
instead a ton of hilarious references and moments to different software terminology 
that I'm sure the astute viewer would catch. It's definitely 
watchable by anybody outside that audience as well, since its made for mainstream audiences, insterested
in the nerdy culture of **Silicon Valley**.

For example, here's a beautiful scene making fun of recruitment:

<div className="ci">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vVlEVRKv4is" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Or the one scene where they hire the genius boy programmer known as **THE CARVER** to help out with their cloud architechture capabilities:

<div className="ci">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kdXKdRoB9Wk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

OR this one... no comment:

<div className="ci">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EUSsEch7dZA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Anyways, I'll stop ranting. Do yourself a favor and go watch it!


# Outro

That'll be it for this one.. I really enjoyed writing down some of the stuff I've been watching/reading.

Some honorable mentions that I didn't feel like writing up: I read about 1/10 of *The Stand by Stephen King*, but wasn't feeling it.
Basically the plot is that everyone gets a disease and dies. Reminded me too much of today, maybe I'll go back and finish it later...

I watched *Mr Robot* Season 1, which was really good, albeit a bit trippy sometimes. Also I wish there was more hacking involved.
But I don't feel like writing it up, and there are still three seasons to go.

<div className="ci">
    <img src="https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p12922738_b1t_v9_aa.jpg"/>
    <p>The soundtrack of this show is so damn good</p>
</div>

I read about 1/2 of *the Diary of Anne Frank*, all I gotta say is, damn I wish I could write that well at age 13.
It was especially sad reading through the book, knowing that she didn't make it out. But such is the Holocaust.

Finally, I am trying to read **Catch 22** (started at the beginning again for the 5th time, why does Heller write with such long sentences?)

Anyways, if you have any good shows, books, music or anything else to recommend, feel free to shoot me some recs!

**Thanks for reading!**

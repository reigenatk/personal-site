  <p>**** yeah baby TED talks WOOOOo</p>
</div>

You guys ever watch TED talks? No? Just me?

TED talks are awesome. See, this is how I feel when I make a blog post. Everyone gathering to listen to my wisdom and all.
Except there is no audience and my topics aren't nearly as interesting... &#128540;

# Enough Rambling

What was the topic? Oh yeah. Learning things. See, I've always wanted to write about a new habit of mine, taking online courses.

I got into the hobby of taking MOOCs about 1.5 years ago, back during the summer of 2020.
For those of you who don't know, MOOC stands for "Massive Open Online Courses".

  <p>You've probably heard of these before</p>
</div>

Think sites like udemy, or coursera. Skilled instructors upload courses to these sites, and you can enroll
in them. Some of these are free, like Khan Academy or Coursera.
Some sites charge money, like udemy, but its usually no more to enroll in a course than to eat
at the chipotle down at green street.

# You can learn anything...

I swear theses sites have courses on literally everything.

Wanna learn blockchains? 603 results.

Need to learn how to learn so you can start learning properly? Boom.

    className="inline-img"

  <p>Apparently 3 million people don't know how to learn yet...</p>
</div>

Each course typically comes with a rating that is from my experience, quite authentic. And
if you stick to a course with a ton of students, the Q&A sections are super vibrant and if you have
a problem, chances are there's already a discussion on it where you can just find the answer like that.

I've taken stuff on:

- Unity 3D
- Docker
- React
- General Webdev
- iOS dev
- Gatsby
- NodeJS
- Advanced CSS
- Video Editing (Davinci)
- Solidity (in progress)
- Pixel Art (in progress)
- Unity 2D (in progress)
- Blender (when I stop being lazy)

  <p>Wow richard nice humble brag</p>
</div>

So what, you ask? Why should I listen to you? You aren't being paid by Udemy, **why
are you so enthusiastic about online courses?**

Well, here are some reasons I like them so much:

1. **Entirely self paced**

   You ever read a book in high school english class and just hate the book? Not because the book was bad,
   but because of the deadlines? Read to page 30 by monday, read to page 86 by tuesday, etc. etc.
   Why can't I just read the book at my own rate!?

   To me, **learning is just like reading a book**. You should do it at your own pace to get the most out of it.
   School sometimes forces things down our throats. Cram the day before
   a test, and then forget it the next. Have you ever heard someone say that?

   Also, school goes at a fixed pace. What if this week was super easy and I want to skip ahead? Welp, better
   wait until next week. Just twiddle your thumbs until then. Woops, this next week is super hard
   and I have no clue what I'm doing? Well too bad, because we're moving on and leaving you in the dust.
   Sounding a little more relatable?

   Online courses on the other hand- if I don't feel like learning **I'll just turn the freaking thing off.**
   And when I feel like learning I can skip ahead all I like. It's this flexibility that I really love.

    forgetting it and don't care about it
  </p>
</div>

2. **Courses are long and build up**

   Courses are from my experience, are built to start easy and get progressively harder. Also, MOOCs are LONG.
   And I really mean it. I'm pretty sure the average length for all the courses I listed above comes to around **20 hours each.**

   Now at the same time, 20 hours isn't really that long. Game of thrones was 63.5 hours long, and I watched that
   entire thing.

   <div className="captioned-image">
     <img
       src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjkwZjkzYjYtNjdhYS00ZDZjLThhMmQtZGEwOTg3ODMwMTQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"
       className="inline-img"
     />
     <p>The ending was good, don't hate me </p>
   </div>

   But it is 20 hours + all the actual stuff you do alongside the instructor. Pausing videos, coding along (in the case of coding courses),
   running that code, debugging errors, it all adds up.

   Now why am I emphasizing length? Well, simply because this is where **in my opinion, MOOCs beat out free sources like Youtube.**

   Quality is typically higher! Yes, you can learn how to, say, make a game in Unity by watching tens, if not hundreds of fragmented videos on
   Youtube. But that's the thing- they are **fragmented**. Each video is made by a different person on a different subject,
   with no coherency between videos. In an online course, the instructor **tailors the topics** so that they bounce off one another,
   with the understanding that you have just learned topic X, and it is now time to transition to topic Y which is related to X, or would go
   well while X is still fresh in your mind. The videos are crafted for a fluid learning experience. That's why I value it.

  ></iframe>
  <p>Your average coding tutorial on Youtube... (I'm just kidding)</p>
</div>

Now I'm not saying you can't learn at all on Youtube. **Plenty of people do.** It's just that for someone like me,
its satisfying to check off a video one by one until the entire course is done. I lack motivation a lot of the times,
and having a course with all the videos I need to watch, laid out before me, does wonders for motivating me.
The alternative would be having to **find** videos myself- which is hard sometimes.

Plus, its nice to have a **consistent
quality**- no mumbling, no change of style or formalities, just consistent, straight learning. After all,
we all know there are good youtube videos, and just as many bad ones to back them up.

3. **I learn what I want!**

   Look, school is fine. But sometimes I'm not feeling the material. Like I can't say I'm excited
   to learn what a context-free-grammar is, or how to get the MGF from a gamma distribution.
   Or how it will ever benefit me in the future.

   I mean seriously, if I had just stuck to schoolwork, **I wouldn't even know how to make a simple webpage.**
   Or what an API is. Or how game engines work. Or what a Dockerfile does. I could go on.

   These courses have provided so much insight into topics that I would never get exposure to, topics
   that aren't included in my school curriculum. And they've helped me create lots of projects to
   showcase the stuff I'm learning.

  <p>Probably you right now</p>
</div>

Okay. I'm done ranting. I've probably made you fall asleep already. Sorry for that. I'm almost done.

**There's nothing special about any of these sites in particular**. I'm not saying you have to go take an MOOC. What I'm trying to get at is
the **importance of learning things outside of school**, of expanding your knowledge bank. How it's helped me
create interesting projects that I can learn from and even land opportunities with (my React project
was a nice point of discussion for landing my first internship).

I think all people should strive to keep learning because it truly is **the way in which we advance ourselves.**
Don't just stick to what you learn in school, or be happy with what you already know. Keep finding any means by which you can challenge yourself
with new knowledge!

I'm writing this for myself too. Playing League of Legends for 4 hours is
**NOT** a productive use of time, Richard.

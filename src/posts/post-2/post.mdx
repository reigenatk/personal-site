You guys ever watch TED talks? No? Just me?

TED talks are awesome. See, this is how I feel when I make a blog post. Everyone gathering to listen to my wisdom and all. Just me? Oh..

# Enough Rambling

What was the topic? Oh yeah. Learning things. See, I've always wanted to talk about my habit of self-learning.

I got into the hobby of taking MOOCs about 1.5 years ago, back during the summer of 2020.
For those of you who don't know, MOOC stands for "Massive Open Online Courses".

  <p>You've probably heard of these before</p>
</div>

Think sites like udemy, or coursera. Skilled people upload courses to these sites, and you can enroll
in them. Some of these are free, like Khan Academy or Coursera.
Some sites charge money, like udemy, but its usually no more to enroll in a course than to eat
at the chipotle down at green street.

  <p>Mmmmmm... burrito</p>
</div>

These sites have courses on literally anything you can imagine. Just put it in and more than likely,
there's gonna be some course on it.

Wanna learn blockchains? 603 results.

Wanna train your cat to shake your hand? Say no more.

Need to learn how to learn so you can start learning properly? Boom.

  <p>Apparently 3 million people don't know how to learn yet...</p>
</div>

Each course typically comes with a rating that is from my experience, quite authentic. And
if you stick to a course with a ton of students, the Q&A sections are super vibrant and if you have
a problem, chances are there's already a discussion on it where you can just find the answer like that.

I've taken stuff on:

- Unity 3D
- Docker
- React
- General Webdev
- iOS dev
- Gatsby
- NodeJS
- Advanced CSS
- Ethereum Dev (in progress)
- Pixel Art (in progress)
- Unity 2D (in progress)

So OK richard, you say, nice humble brag. Why should I listen to you? You aren't being paid by Udemy, why
are you so enthusiastic about online courses?

Well, here are some reasons I like them so much:

1. Entirely self paced

   You ever read a book in high school english class and just hate the book? Not because the book was bad,
   but because of the deadlines? Read to page 30 by monday, read to page 86 by tuesday, etc. etc.
   Why can't I just read the book at my own rate!?

   To me, learning is just like that. School sometimes forces things down our throats. Cram the day before
   a test, and then forget it the next. Have you ever heard someone say that? Now why is that so? You were better
   off just never learning it then, if you're just going to forget it the next day!

   Also, school goes at a fixed pace. What if this week was super easy and I want to skip ahead? Welp, better
   wait until next week. Just twiddle your thumbs until then. Woops, this next week is super hard
   and I have no clue what I'm doing? Well too bad, because we're moving on and leaving you in the dust.
   Sounding a little more relatable?

   Online courses on the other hand- if I don't feel like learning I'll just turn the freaking thing off.
   And when I feel like learning I can skip ahead all I like. It's this flexibility that I really love.

2. Courses are long and build up

   Courses are from my experience, built to start easy and get progressively harder. Also, MOOCs are LONG.
   And I really mean it. I'm pretty sure the average length for all the courses I listed above comes to around 20 hours each.

   Now 20hours isn't really that long. Game of thrones was 63.5 hours long, and I watched that.

   <div className="captioned-image">
     <img
       src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjkwZjkzYjYtNjdhYS00ZDZjLThhMmQtZGEwOTg3ODMwMTQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"
       className="inline-img"
     />
     <p>The ending was good, don't hate me </p>
   </div>

   But it is 20 hours + all the actual stuff you do alongside the instructor. Pausing videos, coding along (in the case of coding courses),
   running that code, debugging errors, it all adds up.

   Now why am I emphasizing length? Well, simply because this is where in my opinion, MOOCs beat out free sources like Youtube.

   Quality is typically higher! Yes, you can learn how to, say, make a game in Unity by watching tens, if not hundreds of fragmented videos on
   Youtube. But that's the thing- they are fragmented. Each video is made by a different person on a different subject,
   with no idea of each other. In an online course, the instructor tailors the topics so that they bounce off one another,
   with the understanding that you have just learned topic X, and it is now time to transition to topic Y which is related to X, or would go
   well while X is still fresh in your mind.

   Now I'm not saying you can't learn at all on Youtube. Plenty of people do. It's just that for someone like me,
   its satisfying to check off a video one by one until the entire course is done. Plus, its nice to have a consistent
   quality of video- no mumbling, no change of style or formalities, just consistent, straight learning. After all,
   we all know there are good youtube videos, and just as many bad ones to back them up.

3. I learn what I want!

   School is fine. But sometimes I learn things I don't care about. Like seriously. And yes, I know, I'm still
   young and have no clue where something might come in handy in the future. But do I really need to know what the
   heck a context-free-grammar is? Or the moment generating function of the exponential distribution? I mean yeah
   it's nice to know but sometimes school can be really abstract. And I find that lots of these courses focus on applicability.
   Something you can do and apply immediately. And sometimes I think my schoolwork lacks that.

   I mean seriously, if I had just stuck to schoolwork, I wouldn't even know how to make a simple webpage.
   Or what an API is. Or how games are made. Or what a Dockerfile does. I could go on.

   These courses have provided so much insight into topics that I would never get exposure to, topics
   that aren't included in my school curriculum. And learning more is a great feeling. Every day, knowing
   that you are improving yourself in some way, by exercising your brain, just as you would your body.

# NAT

# Firewalls

For example, here's a list of some of the IP's that are messing with my firewall...

<div className="ci">

  <p>Almost one packet coming in every 10 seconds or so... &#128544;</p>
</div>

Here, the _destination IP_ represents the IP of the person sending me the packets...
The third column is the destination IP, which would be MY IP address. But seeing as I'm already being spammed
I feel like leaking that isn't the best idea.

  <p>Some extra info</p>
</div>

The last two columns are the protocol (TCP or UDP) and the reason it was blocked, most of them
say _'Generic Discards'_ but some say _DOS attack_ or _Invalid Packet_... Strange.

If you look up some of these IPs, you get some really interesting results...

For example, I got a packet from 162.142.125.88, and when you look it up it writes down the name
of the packet...

  <p>hmmm</p>
</div>

You can see they are based somewhere in kansas. Now let's look up the name they have put down...

And boom, we find this nice website explaining that they are scanning the entire internet!

  <p>A public scanning project... cool!</p>

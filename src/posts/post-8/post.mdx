# Damn

It's been so long.

I figured I would <span className="lo">update</span> this blog, even though I really don't feel like writing.
Summer ends in about a week for me, and I have to say I'm kinda ~~dissapointed~~ 
as to how it went. I don't think I was doing very well mentally, and it messed me up in many ways.
 
For probably the first time in my life, I can say I was **depressed**. <span className="black">Low productivity,
trouble waking up, doing basic stuff, and an overwhelming sense of loneliness.</span> I don't need 
to go to the doctor to know what's up.

<div className="ci">

  <p>Live action of me during the summer</p>
</div>

I actually recorded a <span className="lr">vlog series on a Youtube channel</span>, mostly 
trying to get away from the crippling loneliness. <span className="ly">This video series was 7 episdoes long, 1 hour each, of me just ranting about life.</span>

I did this because I talk to myself quite a bit, and figured I'd 
record it. <span className="lb">The channel itself is private though</span>, and I'm not planning on sharing the name anytime soon.
It's quite embarassing, honestly. But I feel like in some way, <span className="lg">I'm doing something important</span> by 
documenting how I feel.

**Hopefully** this next summer, this next YEAR will be better. The reason my summer sucked was simple, I had a terrible year.
I made no friends the last two semesters, and <span className="lv">spent more time sitting in my room than I'm happy to admit.</span>

The fix? Well, be more social, I guess. 

I always find summer to be **the hardest time of the year** since I need to come up with things to do, whereas
during school you have things being assigned to you, and more obligations that 
take up your time. Also, more access to social life. It sounds crazy, but I kinda like school <span className="lg2">because it gives me a sense of purpose</span>... In a twisted way.

<div className="ci">

  <p>Hooray yipee I love school!</p>
</div>

I guess I like being told what to do, or rather, I like to 
feel like I'm accomplishing something concrete. <span className="lr">That's something school 
does well</span>, it's a sense of structure, since each week you have X due, or Y assigned, and 
it doesn't feel like you're really wasting time as you have a baseline you need to get done 
for a decent grade.

# le 4Chin

I also started to read <span className="lg">4chan</span> a lot this summer (mostly r9k), for better or worse... Most likely for worse. I don't plan to 
keep reading it, though it is addicting, just like any other social media site.

Before you judge me, let me say that <span className="lb2">it's helped me cope a lot.</span> I don't go on there for the 
negative things, rather, I usually read other people's stories about life. So no, I'm not an aspiring mass shooter, or a racist.
And frankly, I think people who are that quick to make judgements are silly. *After all, they themselves are probably racist in subtle ways that they don't even see.*

I feel like I had to say this because, well, 4chan attracts a certain crowd. 

And while lot of that crowd is legitamately crazy, **many are also normal humans**, and many are also vulnerable at times, and share great stories or life advice.
Knowing that my life is at a low point, it comforts me 
to hear other people talk about their struggles socializing and fitting in. It makes me feel normal, in a way.


Hell, I could talk forever about this, but I won't since that's not the focus of this post.
What I'm saying is, <span className="lg">it's just a social media site that has a bad reputation, because of a select few (ahem mass shooters) who have used it. 
That doesn't mean only bad people use it.</span> Also, <span className="lr">it's completely anonymous</span>, which I think makes it one of the last 
free places on the internet, in a way.

  <p>Please don't tell me any recruiters are reading this...</p>

# The good stuff

Anyways, enough about the bad stuff. There were definitely some <span className="lb2">good things</span> that came from this summer. I learned lots of new things (all on my Github)
Most notably, I...

1. ** picked up Golang** 
    - I wrote a simple <span className="lr">blockchain</span> and also a <span className="black">torrenting client</span> , which was fun!

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/10/golang.png" />
  <p>What did the Go programmer say when his code didn't work? "Go, god dammit!"</p>
</div>

2. <span className="lv">wrote a CSGO cheat</span>, 
    - This was the coolest thing I've ever done and opened my eyes to the world of RE (Reverse Engineering). I did lots of IDA pro, debugging, even wrote a <b>Windows kernel driver</b> at the end.
3. *Wrote an interpreter*, 
    - Finally giving CS421 a bit of justice. This was mostly done by following a book called Crafting Interpreters.
4. <span className="lb">Did an internship at <a href="https://imanage.com/">iManage</a>,</span> 
    - It's a small software company in Chicago. This company had very heavy startup vibes despite not being a startup. <span className="lo">It's just a small company.</span> I did have to ride the metra for a 2-hour roundtrip everyday, though. But it was nice, as it broke up the rhythm of sitting at home all day.

<div className="ci">

  <p>Any metra riders?</p>
</div>

5. Started work on a indie 2D RPG..
    - Which I am still working on now. It's hard, man. Making a <span className="ly">low quality/mid game</span> is really easy (like my *cough* first game), 
    but creating something actually good, **that goes beyond the status of "prototype" requires so much work.**
    Anyways, here's a few progress pics, I'm really trying my best for this game and hope I can make it 
    something worth playing in the end. 
    <span className="lr">The game itself is supposed to be an atmospheric, emotional game</span> and is actually inspired by themes such as loneliness, being in that awkward age range of 19-21,
    having troubles fitting in (AvPD/social anxiety, etc.) So basically, my life lmao

    
<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/cy2IWYw.jpg" />
  <p>Inside the Union</p>
</div>

The thing is, I'm not an artist, I'm a programmer. So it might look pretty average. **I'm hoping the story, music, and 
gameplay can make up for my subpar graphics ðŸ¤£**

But yeah, I'm really trying to make this game good. Something that I find myself doing very rarely.
Like, usually with my projects, I'll just get the main ideas and move on. But for once, <span className="black">I want to try making something with all the creative juices that I've got. While I'm still young, and have energy to do so!</span>

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/uXk6HO2.jpg" />
  <p>Campus</p>
</div>

And yes, it's inspired by the university that I attend ðŸ˜¶

Anyways, <span className="lg">that's enough rage typing for me</span>, hope you guys are all well. May this year 
go well for all of us.

Time to get back on the grind.

# Intro

Hello! Long time no post. No, I am not dead. I've just been really lazy. And quite frankly, typing blog posts is
hard which is why **I've started messing with youtube videos**.

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://cdn.frankerfacez.com/emoticon/557676/4" />
  <p>Pause Champ?</p>
</div>

You heard me right, I am starting my youtube career. Typing is tiring, talking is just so much
more efficient. Read on to see which video I made 😈 (or don't, here's the <a href="https://youtu.be/DIaYQfR8Qkg">link</a>
if you don't wanna read my blog post.)

Anyways, about life, <span className="lo">Christmas break went by really fast</span>. Then the first month of school. Then the second. Honestly, IDK where the time
went. It's not like I was being super productive either, time just goes really fast when you're dumb like me and don't know what
to do with your life, I guess. Truth be told, I've been in a bit of a slump, productivity wise. Maybe I'm depressed. Or maybe
I'm just making excuses for being lazy. Not sure.

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://media.makeameme.org/created/where-did-all-5a5d08.jpg" />
  <p>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</p>
</div>

Now it's Febuary and I just remembered
that I have a blog that no one reads. And I haven't posted in a while. So here I am, writing this post.

I made the rather rash decision to spend my christmas break learning all about _Computer Networking!_ The main motivation
was because I am interested in Cybersecurity, but it's hard to understand Cybersecurity without first having a solid basis
in networking. <span className="lb">Literally everyone</span> will tell you that you should "obtain a solid foundation in networking" before aspiring to
do anything security related. Otherwise you will be that script kiddie asking on online forums how to hack 127.0.0.1

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/901/991/d06.jpg" />
  <p>LOIC = Low Orbin Ion Cannon, a DDoS tool and a script kiddie favorite</p>
</div>

I always ignored this advice because I was arrogant and thought: _"pshhhhhhhh, how much is there to know? I mean hell, I know
what an IP address is. Isn't that enough?"_ <span className="lg">I can assure you that I couldn't have been more wrong.</span> There are probably millions of lines of
code, dozens of algorithms created by smart people, multiple organizations and standards, and
a hell of an effort spanning many decades, that helps that help your computer send just a <span className="lr">singular packet</span> to some server online.

Another motivation for me was actually my Citadel interview, earlier on during this recruiting season.

During my third interview, the guy interviewing me asked me to describe what happens from the moment you type in
"www.google.com" in your web browser, to when you get a fully loaded webpage. I remember giving an answer that briefly covered HTTP/HTTPS, and a bit
of DNS. But I sure as hell couldn't give him the details.

He asked me if I knew what TCP/UDP was, to which I said something along the lines of "Oh yeah, I heard of that before".
He probably realized then and there that <span className="lr">I
only knew the basics</span>, and didn't ask me about more important concepts like packet fragmentation, and the OSI model. Probably
because he didn't want to embarass me.

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/KpmUiT6.jpg" />
  <p>ok this meme sucks lol</p>
</div>

Looking back at the interview now, I wish I could redo that answer. Not because I want to get into Citadel (tbh screw citadel,
read my <a href="https://rmaa.dev/posts/flash-boys">HFT post here</a> for reasons why), but
because I wanna actually answer that question properly.

Back when I was interviewing, I thought I had done a <span className="lg">great job answering the question.</span>
Now looking back, I realized I touched on barely half of the
entire answer, and the guy interviewing me probably realized <span className="lr">I had no real networking knowledge!</span>

Just for fun, <span className="lb">I'll list a bunch of terms</span> I encountered that I never knew before starting this study.
~~See how many you know!~~ I'll tell you, **I thought I knew many of these well**, especially in the easy category, but when I really
saw the bigger picture and read more about them, I was shocked to find out how _surface level_ my understanding actually was. And
sorry if this seems kinda flex. I don't claim to understand all of these perfectly.

# Easy Mode

The essentials, and things you've probably heard of.

<ol>
  <li>IP address</li>
  <li>Ethernet, MAC address</li>
  <li>Security: Firewalls, port numbers, </li>
  <li>Reserved IP ranges- Class A/B/C/D/E. Special addresses (loopback)</li>
  <li>
    OSI Model (Layers 1-7), can you name them? What is an example of each layer?
  </li>
  <li>TCP/IP Model (Layers 1-4)</li>
  <li>IPv4 vs IPv6 and IPv4 exhaustion. How is IPv6 different?</li>
  <li>
    Hardware: Routers, Switches, Hubs, WAPs, NIC. What are the differences
    between each device?
  </li>
  <li>LANs, WANs, and typical topologies</li>
</ol>

# Medium

This stuff I had heard of in the past either from studying Cybersecurity
or just from random readings, but didn't really understand until I <span className="lb">dug a little deeper.</span>

<ol>
  <li>
    TCP/UDP, what's the difference between the two? Describe the three way
    handshake.
  </li>
  <li>QUIC, ICMP, what do each of these do? What is a Layer 3 protocol?</li>
  <li>
    Common services + associated port numbers (what port are HTTP, HTTPS, DNS,
    FTP, etc. on?) What is a ephemeral port number? Reserved port number?
  </li>
  <li>ARP and why it is necessary. ARP tables.</li>
  <li>
    Subnetting- why do we do it? What is a /24 network? A /16? Can you tell me
    how many devices are on each network, and what the subnet/broadcast masks
    are?
  </li>
  <li>
    Broadcast, Multicast, Unicast + how they differ from each other when
    travelling through a network. Why is an IP ending in .255 important?
  </li>
  <li>
    The Default Gateway, what is it? Port forwarding, DMZs, router configuration
    using web interface.
  </li>
  <li>
    DNS- FQDNs, subdomains, root nameservers, certificates/certificate
    authorities. DNS caching. A, CNAME, AAA records.
  </li>
  <li>
    DHCP servers and NAT. Public vs private IP. What is special about IP
    addresses starting in 192.168? Can you tell me your public + private IP, and
    what the difference is between them?
  </li>
  <li>VPNs and encryption (how do VPNs work?)</li>
  <li>ASNs- what is an ASN?</li>
  <li>
    Copper vs Optic cabling, ethernet standards (what is 100BaseT? 1000BaseT?)
  </li>
  <li>
    WiFi standards (a,b,g,ac,n), 2.5 vs 5GHz band and the benefits/drawbacks of
    both, channels, channel width, SSID, WEP, WPA
  </li>
  <li>
    Wireshark (802.11 and IP packet sniffing). Can you explain to me the
    structure of a packet in wireshark, and how this relates to packet
    encapsulation (and the OSI model)?
  </li>
  <li>
    Basic troubleshooting commands (arp -a, netstat -bano, ipconfig /all, etc.)
  </li>
</ol>

# Hard

I mainly put <span className="lb">routing related topics</span> here that I never heard of prior to studying the book, but as I said are important for the
fluid operation of networks worldwide. I learned a bit of routing after finishing the book.

<ol>
  <li>What is Routing? Routing tables and protocols. What is an interface?</li>
  <li>
    Interior Gateway Protocols: OSPF, IS-IS, EIGRP, RIP. When to use each of
    them? How do they work?
  </li>
  <li>Exterior Gateway Protocols: BGP</li>
  <li>Static vs Dynamic Routing</li>
  <li>VLANs</li>
  <li>Spanning Tree Protocol- and why we need it</li>
  <li>Packet Tracer + GNS3. Can you make a simple LAN in an emulator?</li>
  <li>Cisco IOS. How to configure a new router? What is an interface?</li>
  <li>How to run basic WiFi attacks using monitor mode adapters</li>
</ol>

Okay, I'm done bragging. And trust me, I'm not just including vague terminology to seem smart. That's just how many
technologies are responsible for making the internet work properly! I know for
a fact that <span className="lg">my appreciation of the internet is now so much more than what it used to be.</span>
Hell, before this I literally thought that
my ISP was the internet. I also couldn't tell you how WiFi worked, to me it was just _magic travelling through the air_
and getting me to my <a href="https://ankev28.github.io/">favorite website.</a>

# More Ranting

I feel like the people who work in
IT and on the internet infrastructure, are in some ways heroes. **And they don't get any praise for it**.
Most of us just hop online without giving a damn about the technology that enables us to watch streams,
read news, share our thoughts on social media... etc, so freely.

And I mean, **that's understandable**. Not everyone is interested in technology. But for me, an _aspiring tech
nerd_, who's gonna try to code for a living- I think it's important, if not ~~mandatory~~ that I understand
how the internet works. After all, without the internet, there would be no Google, no Facebook,
no Doordash, no Apple, no Twitter, no Youtube, no Netflix, no Paypal, no P\*rnhub, no Chegg, no
Uber, no Snapchat... ok I'll stop listing big tech companies &#128534; you get what I'm trying to say. **The internet enables
absolutely everything** and I mean everything.

A prime example of this is entertainment- any of you remember Redboxes? No, just me?

They were these red boxes (literally) filled with movies that were placed outside stores like Walgreens for example.
You would put in some money and it would dispense a physical DVD to you with a specific movie. Then you would
return it later once you were done.

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/26/business/26APOLLO/26APOLLO-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale" />
  <p>I always wanted to use one of these!</p>
</div>

But then Amazon + Netflix came along, killing these cute red boxes along with its older brother Blockbuster.
Hell, blockbuster is so dead now that the google page for it uses "was" instead of "is".

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/JiofBkG.png" />
  <p>I'm sure some kids today don't even know what blockbuster is</p>
</div>

# Clout Comparison

I mean, cmon- everyone's heard of Steve Jobs... Bill Gates... But have you even heard of <span className="lb">Vint Cerf?</span>
Exactly.

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Dr_Vint_Cerf_ForMemRS.jpg" />
  <p>Do you know this man?</p>
</div>

He's called the _father of the internet_, and for good reason- he invented TCP/IP, which is the protocol _that the internet depends on to even work._
I'm just saying... he deserves just as much clout as the former two, and yet he only has 32.9K
Twitter followers... That's like less than a small twitch streamer.

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/eMHyM3k.png" />
  <p>
    Nobody knows who or what this guy (and his fellow researchers) have done for
    society! &#128531;
  </p>
</div>

Ok, I'll stop. My point is, the internet is an _engineering feat_, equivalent in my books to something like the moon
landing. <span className="lg">I'm being serious!</span> How is it possible for me to send a packet, that
goes through my home network, through a series of routers, across the Pacific Ocean, and then to Russia, on the other side of the
planet, <span className="lr">two times faster than the blink of my eye?</span> (Average eye blink is 400ms, the ping to this random server
in moscow is only 150ms)

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/zrl8Epa.png" />
  <p>Just think about how amazing this is for a second!</p>
</div>

How have these engineers managed to create a protocol to
serve the <span className="lr bt">4.66 billion</span> people online, roughly <span className="bt">_60% of the global population_</span>, who send a whopping
_2.5 quintillion bytes of data_ (that's 2500000000 GB) each day?

That's what I set out to try and learn a bit better, and I hope I can explain it a bit for you as well.

# Learning

I read a book to learn this information. The book itself was <span className="lp"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-Network-Certification-Seventh-N10-007/dp/1260122387">Mike Meyers' All-In-One Network+ Study Guide.</a></span>
And if you are wondering, yes I highly recommend it. It's the most popular book (at least from waht I could tell
from discussions on the internet) for aspiring network techs and I can verify that it is very good.

It goes at a great pace, fast enough that I was always learning something new, and it is written is such a way that
you could probably get ~~your grandparents~~ up to speed on TCP/IP in no time. In other words, no previous knowledge assumed.
But of course, tons of other resources work as well.

Now this book is for an exam called the **Network+**, which is an entry level certification for IT helpdesk
positions. At first I read the book with the intention of taking the exam, that is, until I realized
that it was ~~348 dollars...~~ Eeek!

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/fpZwySs.png" />
  <p>Yikes!</p>
</div>

So I decided to just gain the knowledge instead by reading the book and writing this blog post to
substitute as a summary of all I have learned. After all, I don't really see myself going into the IT
industry- at least not for now.

Oh also, Before I get started, **let me change the font...**

<div className="new_font_2">

# Boom

There, is that better? This one is called _Mukta_.

Now I can't possibly go over everything I learned, to give you an idea, the notes I took while reading the
book was <span className="lb">a Google Doc that's nearly 100 pages</span>.

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/s27wczu.png" />
  <p>How to get carpal tunnel</p>
</div>

<div className="question">
  I like to take notes when I learn things,{" "}
  <span className="lo">
    mainly so I can reference things when I wanna go back to them later.
  </span>{" "}
  Especially in something as technical as networking where you have a billion
  terms and its nice to have pictures and annotations to understand what a topic
  was (for example, if I wanna know wtf a DHCP server is, I can just read what I
  wrote when learning it).
</div>

There's no way in hell I can cover all the stuff I've learned. So I will outline the more interesting things that I think
people should know about: Switch vs. Router vs. WAP, NAT (network address translation), and Firewalls.

Then I will link a nice video I made about Wireless Hacking, if you're interested 😉

# Devices!

So to begin understanding the internet, let's talk about devices. There's really only three devices you need to know of. **Switches, Routers, WAP**.
Unfortunately, today they are all bundled into one big old thing that everyone calls "the router", but its important to understand
how each of these devices differ from one another <span className="lg">in terms of what they do.</span>

A _Switch_ works on _Layer 2_ of the OSI model (Link Layer), connecting devices to a single centralized hub. If you've ever setup
ethernet, you would know you take an ethernet cable, put it into your PC and then take the other end and put it into a switch
(or often times, the wall, which will then run a connection to the switch). It looks a little something like this:

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/AerrC-xLaDghM3wJi12zbJUzoVU=/1416x400/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ubiquity-48-port-switch-d1544208be7c4845b49b75974241a2fa.jpg" />
  <p>Each of the holes is called a port.</p>
</div>

A _Router_ works on _Layer 3_ device (Network Layer), working with TCP/IP which is where IP addresses live. It does
not connect to client PCs. Instead, <span className="lg">its main job is to forward traffic.</span>

A _WAP (WIFi Access Point)_ is like a switch, but for WIFi. That's the best way to describe it.
It simply gathers all WiFi signals into one place and sends that data to the router. Since WIFi doesn't use physical cabling like ethernet does,
you don't have any ports on a WAP. Instead, you have antennas which will read + send signals to and from PCs
in your home network. WAPs also have another important jobs- since WiFi is essentially radio, it needs to transform that signal into
a packet that is ready to be shipped by the router.

Here's a picture of a Router that is doubling as WAP. In other words, it is capable of both receiving all WiFI traffic in a
LAN, as well as sending that traffic to some place.

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/W46xwzwd9HlLUwqpjYpQOxqc3Ck=/1500x1000/filters:fill(auto,1)/71qNsDlUZL._SL1500_-db9624bf30494933b4d2279b89ea19ef.jpg" />
  <p>The famous Linksys router line</p>
</div>

Often times, <span className="lr">these devices are condensed into one!</span>
Your home router probably acts as a switch, a router, and a WAP all at once. But in larger corporate settings, it's really important to
separate these (you might have one switch per floor in a building for instance, then a series of routers to connect to the internet).

Switches and routers are often put into big black racks that look like this:

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/94/87/14/948714771d435db5a8a908af89ba3607.jpg" />
  <p>These are called network racks.</p>
</div>

# LANs and WANs

OK Blah Blah Blah, Why did I just tell you all that? Well now we have all the necessary components to form a simple _Local Area Network_ (LAN)

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cTdvm.jpg" />
  <p>
    Typical LAN consists of clients (PCs), switch to connect them all, a router,
    and a connection to the public internet.
  </p>
</div>

Note how the Switch connects to the PCs, NOT the router. Other things like servers will connect to a switch as well, such as
in this example Mail + File Servers. These connect using physical Ethernet cables, typically the iconic RJ45 cable:

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81QerFqLubL._AC_SY450_.jpg" />
  <p>These color of these are really easy to remember.</p>
</div>

Looking at that LAN diagram again, note how the router does NOT connect to the PCs, it connects to the switch. This is because the router is on Layer 3,
and Ethernet is a layer 2 protocol, so that realm is for the switches. Routers only talk with switches, which have aggregated all the traffic
on a local area network into one central area.

Moving on, note that **the router** is the one that connects with a big cloud labelled _"the internet"_. This is typically <span className="lg">a reference to another router in your ISP's network</span>.
The line that connects your home router with an ISP router (which assumedly
lives on their premises somewhere physically) is typically an underground cable.

If you trace the physical cable connection coming from your home router, it will probably go out of the
wall and ~~somewhere into the ground~~ (unless you are using satellite, which is rare). ISPs are responsible for
laying a line that safely connects a client (us) to their physical network (probably somewhere a few miles away). Wiring is either a <span className="lb">copper or fiber
optic line</span>, the latter of which is typically much faster and is starting to be offered by ISPs nationwide.

ISPs then form a network of routers. One of the routers in the ISP network will receieve your packet,
and then smartly route it <span className="lg">as quickly as possible</span> to your desired destination.

How does it know what route is best? Using a <span className="lb">routing protocol of course!</span> ISPs typically run one call IS-IS. It might also use
the BGP protocol if your request is travelling far.

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://routebig.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/What-is-Routing-1024x512.jpeg" />
  <p>The internet is nothing more than a series of networks!</p>
</div>

So to summarize, an ISP is nothing more than a bunch of routers connected together! ISPs are responsible for maintaining a physical
connection to your house, as well as making sure they have connectivity to other ISPs. Together, ISPs form a Wide Area Network, <span className="lr">which is just many local area networks
(like your home network) that are interconnected via routers.</span> In other words, the internet is just a ton of LANs connected together via <span className="lg">millions of routers,</span> owned by
ISPs and many different organizations!

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Internet_Connectivity_Distribution_%26_Core.svg/440px-Internet_Connectivity_Distribution_%26_Core.svg.png" />
  <p>
    ISPs come in tiers, and organize themselves in specific ways to ensure
    optimal connectivity
  </p>
</div>

In other words, when you go to "google.com", you are really sending a packet that gets routed through tons of ISP routers, and to
the Google LAN, where there is a web server listening. Yes, your packet _physically travells there_ and back. Amazing! In fact,
you can even see which routers specifically using a command.

Go to a **command prompt**, and type in the command _tracert google.com_, or whatever website you want. You can see
each router hop it takes, the IP of that router, and how long it took for that specific route. Isn't that cool?

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/4SgTMYv.png" />
  <p>Each hop it took for a request to pornhub!</p>
</div>

Let's actually dive a bit deeper- I highlighted three names here. <span className="lr">Pavlov Media, Cogentco, and Reflected.Net.</span> I can
tell you that _Pavlov Media is the name of my ISP_. But what is Cogentco? Well if we look it up:

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/aFhF33I.png" />
  <p>Each hop it took for a request to pornhub!</p>
</div>

We see it is an ISP as well! And not just any ISP, but a <span className="lb">Tier 1 ISP</span>. Cool! So Pavlov seems to be sending
my packet over to Cogentco's network of routers. Then Cogentco sends it to something called Reflected.net

Let's lookup Reflected.Net:

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/OmWxTOQ.png" />
  <p>A Domain Hosting service!</p>
</div>

This is a _Web Hosting service_. Basically, they provide the servers, all you need to provide is the code for your site!
So when someone makes a request to your site, it goes to their servers and you don't have to build a server yourself.
Makes sense! So if you took away nothing, remember that Pornhub uses Reflected.Net hosting 😏

# Physical connections

Now you might ask- **how do ISPs connect to one another?** The answer, via physical cabling.

This goes back to the title image of this blog post- an <span className="lr">underground fiberoptic cable</span>
crossing the Atlantic Ocean, that connects internet traffic between the Eastern and Western
Hemispheres.

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://acacia-inc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Submarine-Cable-Networks.jpg" />
  <p>An undersea internet cable! Looks like a snake.</p>
</div>

<div className="question">
  Yes, our connectivity to Europe depends on a literal physical wire, somewhere
  deep in the Atlantic Ocean. Isn't that absolutely crazy?
</div>

If you want to be
amazed, check out <a className="lb" href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/">this sweet map</a>
with ALL the internet cables underwater, servicing every single packet that
is sent across the ocean. **Did you know that 95% of internet traffic is sent through
underwater sea cables?**

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/d8vhGSV.png" />
  <p>
    These cables connect every single bit of traffic that goes cross-continent!
  </p>
</div>

That's so awesome to me. We depend on the manufacturers of
these cables so much more than we even know. How funny is it to think that **a shark** could literally bite a cable and reduce
internet bandwith of millions, _if not billions of people worldwide_? Next time you lag in your video games,
you can blame a shark (if you are accessing a server across the ocean, that is. Otherwise its a skill issue 😆)

<div className="ci">
  <img src="https://www.te.com/content/dam/te-com/images/energy/global/campaigns/underground/energy-underground-1064x400.jpg" />
  <p>Underground network cabling! This is what connects you to your ISP</p>
</div>

So, in short:

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span className="bt lg">Switches, Routers, and Wifi Access Points</span>{" "}
      make up the majority of LANs
    </li>
    <li>
      <span className="bt lg">Switches connect all the PCs</span> in a network,{" "}
      in contrast <span className="bt lg">Routers connect to switches</span> and
      forward that traffic to other routers (typically your ISP's network of
      routers, which goes to other ISPs, until it reaches your destination)
    </li>
    <li>
      ISPs connect to you + other ISPs{" "}
      <span className="bt lg">via underground cabling</span>, creating the Wide
      Area Network known as "the internet"
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

Alright, that's it for me for today. Next in this series, we will touch on NAT/DHCP and Firewalls.
My hands are too tired for now to continue. Wait, I forgot the video:

# Wifi Hacking 🙈

OK one more thing- along with learning more about networks, I touched on WiFi a bit and decided to get a bit hands on by buying an adapter.

The adapter is called the _Alfa AWUS036ACM_. Now you might ask, well Richard, why not just use your current adapter? Like the one on your
motherboard?

The thing is, most wifi adapters like the ones in our PC are in what's called "managed mode", which means that
it can <span className="lr">only see packets that are destined for it</span> (from the WAP). This means its quite limited,
since you can only see your own traffic, and that's not very useful when it comes to wifi hacking.

This adapter is in "monitor mode", which means
that it can see _ALL the wifi packets in the vicinity_, even ones that aren't designated for it.

This as you can imagine, can lead to some nefarious activities.

I made a <a href="https://youtu.be/DIaYQfR8Qkg">video</a> on how to setup one of these wifi cards for some basic wireshark sniffing (in Kali Linux).
This adapter also supports **packet injection**, which is where you can create packets on the fly and send them out to nearby devices,
for example pretending to be the wifi access point and stealing someone's password.

It's quite technical but I'm glad I made it since

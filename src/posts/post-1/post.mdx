# A Wild Blog Appears!

Hey! If you're reading this, you've probably found my personal blog! Glad you're here.
In this post, I will attempt to recap the construction of my personal site- why I did it,
what challenges I faced, things I learned, etc.

<hr />

# Motivation

There's not much else to say but the fact that **personal sites are awesome!** I think lots of
employers are tired of reading resume after resume- besides, I get to build something and
learn more about web technologies. It's a win win if you ask me, it just takes time to learn.

On the topic of building something- **I really value building personal projects** (if you couldn't tell
by the dramatic quote I put on my [projects page](https://rmaa.dev/projects)). Almost all my webdev
knowledge, and almost all of my other knowledge has come from self-learning. School (at least in my
experience) can only take you so far- I'll rant more about this in a [later post](https://rmaa.dev/posts/productivity).

So yeah, **I could've used a template**, I could've forked some Github project and just changed a few lines
and called it a day. I could've used wordpress. My site wouldn't look nearly as bad. But that wouldn't have been fun, and coding
should be fun! &#128521;

I've seen some really stunning personal sites [(this one for example)](https://montychoy.com/)
and quite honestly, I kind of went down the rabbit hole of web design again. Some
people really know how to make websites! I mean, just look
at [this one](https://youtu.be/BZqzhmlTkAc?t=200).

Of course, I'm not on that level. Heck, I'm happy if my media queries even work and my site looks
ok on mobile. Also, I'm not just making this site for recruiters. To me, it will act as a diary of
sorts. I think it'd be really cool to document the projects I work on over the years, or the thoughts
I have in my blog, and then be able to **look back** and see it all once I'm an older developer. Who knows.

It's nice to be able to post somewhere whenever I feel like sharing something to my (non)existent audience. Or to just write up
a nice blog post of something I learned. All because I don't want to pay $5 a month for Medium &#128540;

Personal Sites are Awesome. Okay not gonna lie I just wanted to show off this cool text-box.

# Technologies!

So then, how did I build this mediocre site you ask? Well I used this wonderful framework called **Gatsby**.

<div className="captioned-image">
  <iframe
    src="https://giphy.com/embed/u4CY9BW4umAfu"
    width="480"
    height="242"
    frameBorder="0"
    class="gif"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
  <p>No, not this Gatsby &#128518;</p>
</div>

**GatsbyJS** is a powerful static site generation framework, which runs on top of three things: **React**,
**Webpack**, and **GraphQL**.

<div className="captioned-image">
  <img
    src="https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*Qz1vQPsgbVratlVCUUQNTg.png"
    className="inline-img"
  />
  <p>Gatsby is built on React, Webpack and GraphQL</p>
</div>

Now I shouldn't really mention **Webpack**, because as a user of Gatsby I never
even interfaced with it. From what I understand, Webpack takes your code and breaks it down into modules,
which allows for easier management, debugging and testing. So it's more of a behind the scenes
tool that the average noob like me will never encounter. Maybe I will meet you in the future, Webpack.

**ReactJS** is a staple in the modern webdev world nowadays. I took a course on it about a year ago,
and honestly enjoyed it a lot. There's something about writing javascript as opposed to the
traditional HTML/CSS that makes you feel more sophisticated. But it also is a lot more powerful
in the sense that you can create components and re-use them everywhere. And with hooks, props, async/await,
state, and just javascript in general being a very flexible language, you can create essentially anything
you want.

As for **GraphQL**, this was an eye opener for me while making this project. Traditionally when making
a site, you put all the content inside of the HTML/CSS files. But GraphQL allows for something called
a **Headless CMS**, or content-management system. I employed one called [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)
to manage my project page! Essentially, a CMS abstracts everything about the code away from a user,
so you can just focus on the content you are writing. The instant you are done, simply press publish,
and it will appear as a new page on your site like magic!

<div className="captioned-image">
  <GatsbyImage
    image={getImage(props.embeddedImages[1])}
    alt="the great gatsby"
    fadeIn
    className="inline-img"
  />
  <p>
    I can just write the projects descriptions for my site in a completely
    separate graphical interface!
  </p>
</div>

GraphQL is what makes this all possible: it connects to the CMS, and then you can easily query
for all the data that you are interested in via the graphQL playground. After writing your query
and fetching it, the data will appear as props inside your components, where you can
destructure the data and display inside the render function in React!

# More Things I learned

Here are some other technologies that I interacted with for the first time, or reinforced in my head
through this project!

1.  **Responsive Design Patterns**

    This is the one part of webdev I absolutely despise, but is absolutely critical.
    Today, more web traffic is actually generated from phones than from computers (50% to 47%, last 3% is tablets)
    I think it's safe to say I've conquered some of my fear of responsive design
    through this project. I learned about:

    - **Media Queries**

      Learned some common widths and heights.
      For example, iPhone 6 screen is only 375 x 667 viewport width even though the resolution
      is around twice that. For reference, desktop is 1920 x 1080! So almost 6x smaller on a phone,
      you need to account for that when making any site!

      How to use "min-width", "max-width", and the likes. Learned what should be changed in
      media queries (usually font sizes, or grid column layouts, but also for things like navbar buttons)

    - **No hard coding pixels**
      Learned how to use root-font-size (16px default at 100%), and how you can (and should)
      use "rem" absolutely everywhere.

2.  **GraphQL** is super cool

    So this was kind of the big new thing I learned from doing this project. I've heard of
    GraphQL many times in the past but have always been too afraid to touch it. Until I realized
    how simple it is to use, and how nice it makes everything.

    - Below is an image
      of the graphQL playground, an awesome GUI that comes built into Gatsby where you can query
      all kinds of data coming into your site. For example, I can query the blog posts on my site,
      the data coming in from a CMS, and all the different images on the filesystem of this site!
      Then I can choose which one I want and display it.

      <div className="captioned-image">
        <GatsbyImage
          image={getImage(props.embeddedImages[3])}
          alt="the great gatsby"
          fadeIn
          className="inline-img"
        />
        <p>The GraphQL playground!</p>
      </div>

    - Syntax for graphql reminds me of javascript objects. In fact, they're basically the same.
      In a javascript object you would have something like

    ```js
    const stuff = {
      i: "don't",
      yes: false,
      3: 2,
      important: {
        ans: "the answer",
      },
      // so on
    }
    ```

    - And say you wanted to query the value of "ans" in graphQL you can just do

    ```js
    const query = graphql`
      {
        stuff {
          important {
            ans
          }
        }
      }
    `
    ```

    - Here's another example of a query. This one is being used in this site right now
      to load up all the projects in the [projects page](https://rmaa.dev/projects), coming in from the CMS:

    ```js
    const query = graphql`
      {
        allContentfulProject(sort: { fields: projectName }) {
          nodes {
            projectImage {
              gatsbyImageData(layout: CONSTRAINED, placeholder: TRACED_SVG)
            }
            projectName
            link
            id
            shortDescription
            content {
              tags
            }
          }
        }
      }
    `
    ```

    - To break it down, I get all the projects, and then we want to grab the name, link, descriptions
      and tags! And then as you can see on the projects page, I display the results of this entire
      query onto the site just by use dot notation.

    - In summary, graphQL is super powerful and I am glad I learned it. It really isn't too
      complex but the possibilities are endless. It kinda bridges the gap between frontend and
      backend (where all the assets and data are) and makes development a lot more tolerable in that sense.

3.  **CSS Transitions and Animations** are an easy way to improve a site

    So I touched CSS transitions and animations for the first time, still pretty beginner but I
    tried to spice up the site with them. I'd say it helped! Will keep working on this.

4.  **CSS Grid + Flexbox** are lifesavers for responsive design

    CSS Grid and Flexbox are some of the most powerful CSS tools today, or so I was told.
    After trying to make this site I can see why. They both do so much work behind the scenes, and
    make designing things very intuitive.

5.  General CSS properties

    - Padding + border radius are super important for buttons and layout in general
    - Margin should be used carefully and only when you really need it.
    - Also learned about the reset trick for box-sizing and margins/padding:

    ```css
    *,
    *::after,
    *::before {
      margin: 0;
      padding: 0;
      box-sizing: inherit;
    }
    ```

    - Finally, finding good colors schemes are hard &#128577; but [this site](coolors.co) is pretty cool

6.  **Styled Components** are super useful because you don't have to worry about colliding class names

    Also heard a lot about Styled Components in the past, tried them for the first time.
    They are pretty easy to use and make. 10/10

7.  **SASS** is the best invention ever and should honestly be in default CSS

    First off, thank god I can comment with "//" instead of "/\* \*/", that saves so much time.
    Also, SASS variables are awesome, and allow for even more customizability. Nested CSS is just
    so much more intuitive. And the ability to split everything into its own file,
    makes everything easy to organize. Sass is just better CSS and I have only positives about it.

8.  Component based design!

    If you are making something that will be reused, put it into a component. I had too many components
    to count in this project. Navbar, Footer are some obvious ones but there are more interesting
    use cases like a search engine optimization component that is present in each page, creating metadata
    tags.

9.  **MDX** support for Blog posts!

    I've never been a big user of Markdown, but I guess now is the time to practice! Gatsby has a
    plugin called "gatsby-plugin-mdx" which offers support for MDX. MDX
    is essentially normal Markdown but with support for JSX, meaning you can import entire
    components and put them into your Markdown file! For example, code snippets are made easy
    using MDX. Or say you want to have a nice graphic with a responsive component. I think it'll
    be helpful if in the future, I want ever want to do something like this in a post.

10. **Commentbox** for comments!

    What's a blog without a commenting system? This was pretty easy to integrate, just
    a quick search and a few commands. Look forward to interacting with people (if anyone
    even comments lol)

# Anyways...

If you've gotten this far, thanks for reading! I'm excited to add more content in the future
and fill this website up with awesome stuff, both non-tech and tech related.

Special shoutout to John Smilga and his awesome [Gatsby course](https://www.udemy.com/course/gatsby-tutorial-and-projects-course/)!
He's a great teacher and I learned a lot from the course.

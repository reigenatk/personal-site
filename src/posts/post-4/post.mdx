# Intro 

Hello everyone! &#128519;

In this post I will go over my internship applications!

# Internship

I'm glad to announce I landed an internship at **Faceb**- I mean, <span className="lg">Meta</span>, for the <span className="lb">summer of 2022!</span>

<div className="ci">

    <p> Obligatory Meta logo.. Pretty good logo imo</p>
</div>

Now I could make a blog post **just to brag**, but that would be pretty egotistical. I moreso want to outline 
the preparation and the statistics of my applications since that would be way more interesting to you.
And hopefully, help anybody who is in the same boat (which I will be in again next year &#128557;)

# Applications sent

Overall, I sent out *85 applications* this season. Of those 85, I received *27 OAs* (Online Assesments) and 
85-27 = 58 ghosted me outright (no OA). That's **69%** &#128563; ghosts.

Of the 27, *21* of them rejected me after taking the OA.

Specifically, Of the 21, *16* were nice enough to send a rejection email. 5 ghosted me after the OA.

<div className="ci">

</div>

The 27 - 21 = *6* companies that gave me a face-to-face interview with an engineer were:

1. CME Group
2. Citadel
3. Chase 
4. Ocient
5. Palantir
6. Faceb- I mean <span className="lb">Meta</span> &#128531;

For <span className="lg">CME</span>, I got the final round after passing the initial OA + first interview, but I ~~cancelled~~ it. 

For <span className="lp">Citadel</span>, I passed the OA, first interview, took the final round which was 
three one-hour long interviews, and I got ~~rejected~~.

For <span className="lo">Chase</span>, I passed the video/OA thing, had the final round upcoming, but I ~~cancelled~~ it.

For **Ocient**, I passed their *really hard* OA, had a nice behavorial phone call with the recruiter, 
then ~~cancelled~~ the final round. I think this one was different because Ocient is a startup.

For *Palantir*, I made it past the OA, first interview, but got ~~rejected~~ at the HM screen (behavorial)

For <span className="lb">Meta</span>, I got ~~rejecte~~- just kidding. You know how that one went. &#128513; This was two interviews
after I applied with a referral.

So yeah, hopefully that helps anyone reading this- It's surprising how bigger, more "prestigious" names 
like Palantir + Citadel were willing to give me a shot, meanwhile I couldn't even get a response from less 
"techy" companies like eBay or Roblox. Different companies have **different recruiting cultures**, I suppose. 

# Takeaways

1. Apply Early! 

    I didn't start applying until mid September, which I'm pretty sure is why I got ghosted. The specific
    example in my head is **Amazon**, I know people who applied a few weeks earlier than I did, and got offers + OAs,
    meanwhile I'm still getting emails about how my application is "still being looked at". *Just reject me 
    already*, Jeff.

2. Quality beats Quantity

    This was *the first year* that I did leetcode seriously. I'd heard of it up to this point but never
    used it. I got a ~~premium membership~~ to see company specific questions and then just grinded it over 
    the course of 3 months.

    On that topic- company specific questions *are pretty accurate*. I think literally every question in my 
    facebook interviews was on the list of "Top Facebook Questions", of which I think I did the first 20 or so.

    <div className="ci">
        <img src="https://images2.imgbox.com/89/df/oPJgv60U_o.png"/>
        <p>Sort by Frequency</p>
    </div>

    Just sort by frequency and pick the most recent time period of 6 months, and you got yourself a 
    pretty good guess at what will be asked in an actual interview!

    Leetcode grinding eats up a lot of time. Let's assume each leetcode problem takes 20 minutes to do. This includes the time it takes
    to code and also to look at the discussion afterwards. Then since I did *174* problems,
    that's overall 20 times 174 = *3480 minutes*, or about **58** hours or 2-ish days of time. 
    
    OK, that might be an over-estimate. Honestly I'm not sure how much time I put in because 58 hours sounds a little high. But I definitely 
    did push myself pretty hard.
    
    Also, always read the discussion section for multiple approaches, since 
    chances are someone has a *way better solution* than what you came up with. Always make sure you 
    code up a solution ~~yourself~~, don't just think "oh I know how to implement it".

        <p>My final leetcode progress...</p>
    </div>

    Above is an image of my leetcode, I did 174 problems out of around 2000, with a whopping 
    *14.6%* acceptance rate! That means my code was accepted at a rate slightly better than **1 out of 10** &#128517;
    
    So as you can guess, I submitted *a lot* and got *a ton of errors*. This was a bad habit of mine,
    I like to submit code that's obviously not going to work. But I did it mainly to debug the parts
    that aren't working, with print statements.

        <p>My average submissions tab &#128521;</p>
    </div>

    Also, I have a bit of **competitive programming** experience with things like <a href="http://www.usaco.org/">USACO</a>
    which definitely helped me, since I would say leetcode was *essentially the same thing*.

    For example, I already had *notable experience* with things like DFS/BFS, Binary Search, Dijkstra, etc. due to competitive programming,
    since those algorithms are used so much. The stuff **I had to learn** included linked lists and just refreshing 
    myself on some common time complexities. They will always ask you the time complexity.

3. Don't overdo Leetcode

    Honestly I think I ~~overdid~~ the preparation a bit. I only had 6 interviews which is honestly not that many.
    I didn't even nail all of them. Looking back, a number like *50 problems* probably 
    was enough, just make sure it covers all the topics and you'll be good. After that, I think it's more or 
    less just *diminishing returns*, and time would probably be better spent doing something more interesting &#128579;
    The only reason I'd start leetcoding again is to re-familiarize myself quickly before an interview.


Okay, with that I think I'll end it here. If you're searching for a position, *good luck*! And remember, 
**your interviewer is there to help**. The most important thing is to *share your thought process* 
because more often than not, your interviewer will give you hints! Try to treat it like you're solving a problem with a friend!

Look forward to a post in *approximately 9 months* where I will go over 
the Meta intern experience! Let's hope I don't get fired &#128556;

Thanks for reading! &#128519;
